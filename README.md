## About the Project

Meet e-Tayoga—your friendly guide to smarter farming! The name means “e-agriculture” in
Moroccan Tamazight, and our logo features Tifinagh script to celebrate our rich cultural heritage.
We’re here to merge modern tech with local values, making farming more accessible and
efficient.

In today’s agricultural landscape, farmers often grapple with challenges, particularly water
scarcity, which poses a significant threat to crop yields. Our progressive web app aims to
empower farmers to manage their crops better, optimize irrigation, and make informed
decisions—all backed by earth observation data and IoT technology


## Key Features

**1. Dashboard:** Keep tabs on your crops with our easy-to-use dashboard. Monitor crop health, growth, and water usage in real time.

**2. Chatbot - BOUCHTA:** Meet BOUCHTA, your dedicated virtual assistant designed to facilitate seamless interactions. BOUCHTA simplifies the farming experience by offering three main functionalities:
- Identification: Farmers can easily discover which crops are best suited for their land based on current soil and weather conditions. This feature is critical for regions facing water scarcity, as it recommends crops that require less water while still being viable for local markets
- Prediction: BOUCHTA allows farmers to track the future performance of their crops by monitoring key environmental factors. This predictive capability enables them to anticipate challenges such as drought or excessive rainfall, helping them to adjust their irrigation practices accordingly.
- Optimization: This functionality provides practical insights on optimizing irrigation systems to minimize water waste. Farmers can learn best practices for using technology like drip irrigation, ensuring that every drop counts while maximizing their crop's health and productivity.
- Designed for ease of use, BOUCHTA incorporates text-to-speech technology to assist users who may have limited digital literacy, ensuring that all farmers can benefit from the app.

**3. Forum:** The forum component fosters a collaborative community where farmers can connect, share experiences, and exchange knowledge. Key aspects include: 
- Knowledge Sharing: Farmers can post questions, share best practices, and discuss solutions to common challenges. This open exchange not only enhances individual understanding but also cultivates a culture of continuous learning within the community. 
- Networking Opportunities: The forum acts as a platform for farmers to form connections, enabling collaborations that can lead to joint ventures or shared resources, ultimately strengthening their collective resilience against agricultural challenges.

**4. Alert System:**
The alert system serves as a crucial safety net for farmers. This feature provides timely alerts
about:
- Crop Diseases: Farmers receive alerts about potential threats to their crops, allowing for swift intervention before problems escalate.
- Water Issues: Alerts regarding water availability, irrigation needs, and drought conditions ensure that farmers can take proactive measures to conserve water and
protect their crops.
- Environmental Changes: By integrating real-time data from NASA, the system can warn farmers of extreme weather events, ensuring they remain informed and prepared
for any potential disruptions.


## Why e-Tayoga Matters

In a world increasingly affected by water scarcity and climate change, e-Tayoga stands as a vital resource for farmers. By equipping them with the tools to make informed decisions regarding water management and crop selection, we are not only enhancing agricultural productivity but also promoting sustainability and food security. 

This innovative platform empowers farmers to adapt to changing conditions, ensuring they can thrive in a challenging environment.


## Team Members

We’re a group of tech enthusiasts and problem-solvers with diverse academic backgrounds, united by our shared mission to use technology for good. 
Our goal? To empower farmers with better insights through satellite data to make smarter, sustainable decisions for agriculture. Here’s a bit of who we are:

- **Noura ED DAHBY** – A Knowledge Engineering and Data Science student and our team leader, Noura brings her passion for data-driven solutions to guide our project. She has played a key role in both data analysis and idea conception, and her vision drives us forward for real-world agricultural challenges.
- **Nouhaila ATABET** – A senior year Cyber-security Engineering student, Nouhaila has been instrumental in data collection and AI development. Her contributions ensure that we’re working with high-quality data, and her AI expertise helps us convert it into actionable insights. 
- **Hamza Ba Mohammed** – An engineer and PhD researcher, Hamza is our AI wizard. His contribution lies in developing intelligent models that optimize agricultural decision-making, turning raw satellite data into predictive insights for farmers.
- **Ahmed Idrissi** – A senior year Software Engineering student, Ahmed is responsible for the development side of things. He’s the one building the software and tools that transform all the data and models into something farmers can easily use to make informed choices.
- **Maroua Chattat** – A senior year Engineering student in Geomatics and Topography at IAV, Maroua’s specialty is in spatial data. Her expertise helps us accurately map and analyze land use, making sure our agricultural insights are grounded (pun intended!) in the best possible geospatial information.

Together, we hope to provide farmers with a tool that leads to more sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.
